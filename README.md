# Auto Suggest using Trie

Implemented the auto suggest feature used in browsers to suggest the words from incomplete written words by the user.
Used a Trie data structure to store 20,000 most used words in English.
The autosuggest function returns all the strings having the given prefix, if the given prefix does not exist it return the input string.
